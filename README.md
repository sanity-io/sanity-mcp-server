## 🔌 Quickstart

### Prerequisites

Before you can use the MCP server, you need to:

1. **Deploy your Sanity Studio with schema manifest**

   The MCP server needs access to your content structure to work effectively. Deploy your schema manifest using one of these approaches:

   ```bash
   # Option A: If you have the CLI installed globally
   npm install -g sanity
   cd /path/to/studio
   sanity schema deploy

   # Option B: Update your Studio
   cd /path/to/studio
   npm update sanity
   npx sanity schema deploy
   ```

   When running in CI environments without Sanity login, you'll need to provide an auth token:

   ```bash
   SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN=<token> sanity schema deploy
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > Schema deployment requires Sanity CLI version 3.88.1 or newer.

2. **Get your API credentials**
   - Project ID
   - Dataset name
   - API token with appropriate permissions

This MCP server can be used with any application that supports the Model Context Protocol. Here are some popular examples:

- [Claude Desktop](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user)
- [Cursor IDE](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers)
- Custom MCP-compatible applications

### Add configuration for the Sanity MCP server

To use the Sanity MCP server, add the following configuration to your application's MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sanity": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@sanity/mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "SANITY_PROJECT_ID": "your-project-id",
        "SANITY_DATASET": "production",
        "SANITY_API_TOKEN": "your-sanity-api-token",
        "MCP_USER_ROLE": "developer"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For a complete list of all required and optional environment variables, see the [Configuration section](#️-configuration).

The exact location of this configuration will depend on your application:

| Application    | Configuration Location                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Claude Desktop | Claude Desktop configuration file                 |
| Cursor         | Workspace or global settings                      |
| VS Code        | Workspace or user settings (depends on extension) |
| Custom Apps    | Refer to your app's MCP integration docs          |

You don't get it to work? See the section on [Node.js configuration](#-nodejs-environment-setup).

> [!WARNING] > **Using AI with Production Datasets**
> When configuring the MCP server with a token that has write access to a production dataset, please be aware that the AI can perform destructive actions like creating, updating, or deleting content. This is not a concern if you're using a read-only token. While we are actively developing guardrails, you should exercise caution and consider using a development/staging dataset for testing AI operations that require write access.

### 🔑 API Tokens and Permissions

The MCP server requires appropriate API tokens and permissions to function correctly. Here's what you need to know:

1. **Generate a Robot Token**:

   - Go to your project's management console: Settings > API > Tokens
   - Click "Add new token"
   - Create a dedicated token for your MCP server usage
   - Store the token securely - it's only shown once!

2. **Required Permissions**:

   - The token needs appropriate permissions based on your usage
   - For basic read operations: `viewer` role is sufficient
   - For content management: `editor` or `developer` role recommended
   - For advanced operations (like managing datasets): `administrator` role may be needed

3. **Dataset Access**:

   - Public datasets: Content is readable by unauthenticated users
   - Private datasets: Require proper token authentication
   - Draft and versioned content: Only accessible to authenticated users with appropriate permissions

4. **Security Best Practices**:
   - Use separate tokens for different environments (development, staging, production)
   - Never commit tokens to version control
   - Consider using environment variables for token management
   - Regularly rotate tokens for security

### 👥 User Roles

The server supports two user roles:

- **developer**: Access to all tools
- **editor**: Content-focused tools without project administration

## 📦 Node.js Environment Setup

> **Important for Node Version Manager Users**: If you use `nvm`, `mise`, `fnm`, `nvm-windows` or similar tools, you'll need to follow the setup steps below to ensure MCP servers can access Node.js. This is a one-time setup that will save you troubleshooting time later. This is [an ongoing issue](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/issues/64) with MCP servers.

### 🛠 Quick Setup for Node Version Manager Users

1. First, activate your preferred Node.js version:

   ```bash
   # Using nvm
   nvm use 20   # or your preferred version

   # Using mise
   mise use node@20

   # Using fnm
   fnm use 20
   ```

2. Then, create the necessary symlinks (choose your OS):

   **On macOS/Linux:**

   ```bash
   sudo ln -sf "$(which node)" /usr/local/bin/node && sudo ln -sf "$(which npx)" /usr/local/bin/npx
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > While using `sudo` generally requires caution, it's safe in this context because:
   >
   > - We're only creating symlinks to your existing Node.js binaries
   > - The target directory (`/usr/local/bin`) is a standard system location for user-installed programs
   > - The symlinks only point to binaries you've already installed and trust
   > - You can easily remove these symlinks later with `sudo rm`

   **On Windows (PowerShell as Administrator):**

   ```powershell
   New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path "C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe" -Target (Get-Command node).Source -Force
   New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path "C:\Program Files\nodejs\npx.cmd" -Target (Get-Command npx).Source -Force
   ```

3. Verify the setup:
   ```bash
   # Should show your chosen Node version
   /usr/local/bin/node --version  # macOS/Linux
   "C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe" --version  # Windows
   ```

### 🤔 Why Is This Needed?

MCP servers are launched by calling `node` and `npx` binaries directly. When using Node version managers, these binaries are managed in isolated environments that aren't automatically accessible to system applications. The symlinks above create a bridge between your version manager and the system paths that MCP servers use.

### 🔍 Troubleshooting

If you switch Node versions often:

- Remember to update your symlinks when changing Node versions
- You can create a shell alias or script to automate this:
  ```bash
  # Example alias for your .bashrc or .zshrc
  alias update-node-symlinks='sudo ln -sf "$(which node)" /usr/local/bin/node && sudo ln -sf "$(which npx)" /usr/local/bin/npx'
  ```

To remove the symlinks later:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/node /usr/local/bin/npx

# Windows (PowerShell as Admin)
Remove-Item "C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe", "C:\Program Files\nodejs\npx.cmd"
```

## 💻 Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Build and run in development mode:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Build the server:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

Run the built server:

```bash
pnpm start
```

### Debugging

For debugging, you can use the MCP inspector:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector -e SANITY_API_TOKEN=<token> -e SANITY_PROJECT_ID=<project_id> -e SANITY_DATASET=<ds> -e MCP_USER_ROLE=developer node path/to/build/index.js
```

This will provide a web interface for inspecting and testing the available tools.
