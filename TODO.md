   **PLAN: [plans/test-improvement-plan.md](plans/test-improvement-plan.md)**

   ### Implementation plan
   1. ✅ **Fix TypeScript Configuration and Errors**
      1. ✅ Fix module import errors in quality-validation.test.ts and complexity-check.test.js (Removed these unused files completely)
      2. ✅ Run typecheck:all and address all remaining TypeScript errors
      3. ✅ Ensure consistent TypeScript configuration across all test suites
      4. ✅ Review tsconfig.test.json to ensure it properly includes all test files

   2. ✅ **Resolve ESLint Issues**
      1. ✅ Fix sonarjs/cognitive-complexity configuration in .eslintrc.json (Complexity checking is working correctly through ESLint)
      2. ✅ Update eslint-plugin-sonarjs to latest version and ensure proper configuration
      3. ✅ Address unused variables and imports across the codebase using lint:fix
      4. 🔄 Refactor functions with high complexity scores (above 10)
         1. ✅ Refactored searchContent function in groq.ts
         2. ✅ Refactored query function in groq.ts
         3. ✅ Refactored processPortableTextFields function in groq.ts
         4. ✅ Refactored findReferences function in schema.ts
         5. ✅ Refactored applyPatchOperations function in documentHelpers.ts
      5. ✅ Create ESLint configuration to disable specific rules in test files

   3. ✅ **Improve Vitest Configuration**
      1. ✅ Fix test:unit command to properly run unit and controller tests without including integration tests
      2. ✅ Update workspace configuration to better match test directory structure
      3. ✅ Add controllers workspace to Vitest configuration
      4. ✅ Optimize test timeouts for different test types
      5. ✅ Configure proper test isolation settings for each test type

   4. 🔄 **Unit Test Improvements**
      1. ⬜ Fix test directory structure to ensure tests are properly discovered
      2. ✅ Fix existing unit test failures
      3. ⬜ Add test coverage for controllers without sufficient tests
      4. ⬜ Implement tests for core utility functions
      5. ⬜ Set up proper mocking for external dependencies

   5. ⬜ **Integration Test Enhancements**
      1. ⬜ Fix critical integration test failures
      2. ⬜ Ensure core document operations tests are passing
      3. ⬜ Add integration tests for missing workflows
      4. ⬜ Optimize slow-running integration tests with better setup/teardown

   6. ⬜ **Testing Documentation**
      1. ⬜ Document test categories and their intended use cases
      2. ⬜ Create guide for writing effective tests
      3. ⬜ Document test environment setup requirements
      4. ⬜ Establish clear criteria for test quality

## Medium Priority
1. ⬜ **Test Coverage Analysis**
   - Run and analyze test coverage reports
   - Identify critical areas with insufficient coverage
   - Establish coverage targets for core functionality

2. ⬜ **Test Performance Optimization**
   - Identify and fix slow-running tests
   - Implement parallel test execution where appropriate
   - Optimize test setup and teardown operations

3. ⬜ **Husky Pre-commit Hook Improvements**
   - Update husky to latest version and fix deprecated configuration
   - Implement smarter test selection in pre-commit hook
   - Add selective linting based on changed files

## Low Priority
1. 🔄 **Test Infrastructure Improvements**
   - ✅ Set up continuous integration for automated test runs
   - ⬜ Implement visual reporting for test results
   - ⬜ Create automated quality dashboards

2. 🔄 **Advanced Code Quality Checks**
   - ✅ Add cyclomatic and cognitive complexity checks to pre-commit hooks (Maintained through ESLint)
   - ⬜ Implement jscpd (copy-paste detector) in the CI pipeline
   - ⬜ Create code quality trend visualizations
